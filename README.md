# Student-Desk-Subsystem
Iteration 1 of the subsystem

You are expected to create a program that calculates the points awarded to the user for each of the subjects they have.

1. The user inputs their percentage for a subject.
  Example: Student got 50% for math
            Student inputs that percentage into the program and the program will calculate the point awarded to the student according to the varistys point allocation
            specifications.
            
            According to UWC's point allocation table:
            A matric result of 50% for Math/Math lit will give the student 7 UWC points
 
 2. Once the user has input all of their subject percentages (up to a maximum of 8 subjects) the program will display the total points earned.
